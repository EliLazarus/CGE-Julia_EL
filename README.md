[MPSGE.jl](https://julia-mpsge.github.io/MPSGE.jl) is a Julia package to enable simpler and free CGE modelling integrated into an efficient general use scientific programming language. The package allows for building models by just structuring the data and providing elasticity parameters, following from Tom Rutherford's MPSGE in GAMS.

CGE-Julia_EL: 
An open-source Computable General Equilirium (CGE) model in the Julia language.
This Julia CGE model prject is now defunct. At the point of ending, it was initially developing toward a simple version of a multi-sector Computable General Equilirium, with taxes.
We were building from basic material from the 2010 EcoMod CGE Modeling workshop, and Cecilia Springer's https://github.com/ccspringer/CGE-in-JuMP/blob/master/Model.jl project.
Following Cecilia, we use the Julia JuMP Package, and the Ipopt solver.
Eventually, this should build to be able to use real data and generate results from experiments. This model will aim to be more or less nuetral in terms of region/nation, and number of sectors etc. The particular goal is to model multiple externality taxes.
